# unidata/nctests

This project contains regression and continuous integration tests for the netCDF project. It also contains tests to generate `ABI` reports detailing differences between versions. Details and usage for each set of tests may be found in the appropriate `README.md` found within the `tests-regression/`, `tests-continuous-integration`, `tests-abi` directories.

> These tests are meant to be run as docker images.
